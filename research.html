during the pre-monsoon season, during which the region experiences the highest
atmospheric heating due to high loading of absorbing aerosols. The region, also
a biodiversity hotspot, has observed a decreasing rainfall trend in this
season. Previous aerosol-rainfall studies over India have mostly focused on the
monsoon season, but pre-monsoon rainfall also is an important rainfall
component for this region. This study includes the results of a modelling study
carried out with WRF-Chem model to investigate how aerosols impact the
pre-monsoon rainfall and their mechanisms over this region. The influence of
black carbon (BC) on radiation, clouds, rainfall and rainfall characteristics
has also been investigated. The study shows that aerosols induce changes in
cloud amounts which relates to rainfall changes. The semi-direct effect was
found to be responsible for cloud reduction below 2&nbsp;km altitude, thus
affecting mainly lower-level clouds. Aerosol radiative feedbacks affected
rainfall according to the height of the terrain in the region and tended to
increase and decrease rainfall in general over low and high-terrain areas,
respectively. Aerosol effects suppressed rainfall for more duration than it
caused enhancement. The effect of increasing black carbon emissions showed a
consistent increase in moisture in the region but also a consistent reduction
in clouds, the changes in the spatial distribution of which was also related to
the rainfall changes. BC caused suppression of lower intensity and enhancement
of higher intensity rainfall. These results help to understand better the
effects of aerosols on pre-monsoon rainfall distributions and the mechanisms
involved.<b> </b></span></p>

of aerosols emitted locally within the north-east (NE) India region and those
transported from outside this region to ascertain whether local or transported
aerosols are more impactful in influencing this region's rainfall during the
pre-monsoon season (March–April–May). Due to the existence of a declining
pre-monsoon rainfall trend in NE India, the study also quantified the role of
different aerosol effects in radiative forcing (RF) and rainfall. The study has
been carried out using the WRF-Chem model by comparing simulation scenarios
where emissions were turned on and off within and outside the NE region. The
impact of all emissions as a whole and black carbon (BC) specifically was
studied. Results show that aerosols transported primarily from the
Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) were responsible for 93.98&#8201;% of the PM<span
class=inline-formula><sub>10</sub></span> mass over NE India's atmosphere and
64.18&#8201;% of near-surface PM<span class=inline-formula><sub>10</sub></span>
concentration. Transported aerosols contributed <span class=inline-formula>&gt;50</span>&#8201;%
of BC, organic carbon, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium and dust aerosol
concentration and are hence a major contributor to air pollution. Hence, the
aerosol effects were much greater with transported aerosols. An indirect
aerosol effect was found to be the major effect and more impactful, with
transported aerosols that dominated both rainfall and RF and suppressed
rainfall more significantly than the direct and semi-direct effect. However,
the increase in direct radiative effects with an increase in transported BC
counteracted the rainfall suppression caused by relevant processes of other
aerosol effects. Thus, this study shows atmospheric transport to be an
important process for this region, as transported emissions, specifically from
the IGP, were also found to have greater control over the region's rainfall.
Thus, emission control policies implemented in the IGP will reduce air
pollution as well as the climatic impacts of aerosols over the NE India region.</span></p>

locations having different traffic volumes in 2016–17. The average observed BC
concentrations were 20.58, 6.42, 3.50 and 5.29&#8239;&#956;g/m<sup>3</sup> at

to have significant negative correlations with BC concentrations, while
relative humidity had positive correlations. It was found that vehicles
contributed over 85% of the ambient black carbon at both locations. Black
carbon emission from this dominant source was estimated for 2018, which showed
that from vehicles it increased to 0.44–0.55 Gg in 2018 from 0.29 to 0.33 Gg in
2011, which may result in the adverse impacts on the eco-sensitive Brahmaputra
River Valley and the Himalayas. The transport and deposition of black carbon
under different climatic seasons was modelled using HYSPLIT. The results showed
that black carbon particulates are being transported and deposited all-round
the year in the Himalayas and the surrounding region. Pre-monsoon and monsoon
seasons contributed to the largest amounts of deposition, and a clear relation
was found between deposition and rainfall. The total BC deposited in the

boundary layer (PBL) parameterization schemes in simulating two different
seasons of pre-monsoon and monsoon in India's North-East region through the
Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Twelve one-month simulations were
conducted with the PBL schemes, six each for April (pre-monsoon) and July
(monsoon), and the model outputs were compared against observations. Three
non-local schemes, Asymmetric Convective Model (ACM2), Yonsei University (YSU),
Shin-Hong (HONG), and three local schemes, Quasi Normal Scale Elimination
(QNSE), Mellor Yamada Janjic (MYJ) and Mellor Yamada Nakanishi Nino (MYNN3),
were tested. The meteorological variables of temperature, relative humidity
(RH), wind speed, wind direction, and rainfall were evaluated, and the
performance of each scheme for each meteorological variable is reported. The
2&#8239;m temperature (T2) variable was well simulated by ACM2, MYJ in April,
and YSU in July, while MYNN3 best simulated the 2&#8239;m RH (RH2) during both
seasons. 10&#8239;m wind speed (WS10) and directions (WD10) were better
simulated by MYNN3, HONG and YSU. HONG also best-simulated rainfall in April
and MYJ in July. April and July being rainfall periods, an analysis of the
schemes’ simulated rainfall frequency was also carried out. Moreover, the PBL
schemes were also ranked, considering their combined performance with all the
above meteorological parameters. While considering both the seasons and all
meteorological variables, the scale-aware scheme, HONG, was the best scheme and
can be used to simulate both seasons. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of
surface and atmospheric parameters was also carried out to reason the simulated
meteorology. QNSE expends the highest amount of its surface energy through
surface evaporation, leading to the lowest surface skin temperature and T2
predictions. In contrast, MYNN3 produced the lowest mixing, which caused the
moistest boundary layer, highest RH, cloud cover, and highly overestimated
rainfall. Besides evaluation, which will help to choose a suitable PBL scheme
for weather predictions in this region, this study also identifies the
characteristics and deficiencies of PBL and surface layer schemes for
improvement.</span></p>
