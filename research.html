is carried out over North-East (NE) India during the pre-monsoon
season, during which the region experiences the highest atmospheric
heating due to high loading of absorbing aerosols. The region, also a
biodiversity hotspot, has observed a decreasing rainfall trend in
this season. Previous aerosol-rainfall studies over India have mostly
focused on the monsoon season, but pre-monsoon rainfall also is an
important rainfall component for this region. This study includes the
results of a modelling study carried out with WRF-Chem model to
investigate how aerosols impact the pre-monsoon rainfall and their
mechanisms over this region. The influence of black carbon (BC) on
radiation, clouds, rainfall and rainfall characteristics has also
been investigated. The study shows that aerosols induce changes in
cloud amounts which relates to rainfall changes. The semi-direct
effect was found to be responsible for cloud reduction below 2&nbsp;km
altitude, thus affecting mainly lower-level clouds. Aerosol radiative
feedbacks affected rainfall according to the height of the terrain in
the region and tended to increase and decrease rainfall in general
over low and high-terrain areas, respectively. Aerosol effects
suppressed rainfall for more duration than it caused enhancement. The
effect of increasing black carbon emissions showed a consistent
increase in moisture in the region but also a consistent reduction in
clouds, the changes in the spatial distribution of which was also
related to the rainfall changes. BC caused suppression of lower
intensity and enhancement of higher intensity rainfall. These results
help to understand better the effects of aerosols on pre-monsoon
rainfall distributions and the mechanisms involved.</font></font><font face="Helvetica Neue, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><b>

differentiates and quantifies the impacts of aerosols emitted locally
within the north-east (NE) India region and those transported from
outside this region to ascertain whether local or transported
aerosols are more impactful in influencing this region's rainfall
during the pre-monsoon season (March–April–May). Due to the
existence of a declining pre-monsoon rainfall trend in NE India, the
study also quantified the role of different aerosol effects in
radiative forcing (RF) and rainfall. The study has been carried out
using the WRF-Chem model by comparing simulation scenarios where
emissions were turned on and off within and outside the NE region.
The impact of all emissions as a whole and black carbon (BC)
specifically was studied. Results show that aerosols transported
primarily from the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) were responsible for
93.98 % of the PM</font></font><sub><font face="Helvetica Neue, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">10</font></font></sub><font face="Helvetica Neue, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">

of BC, organic carbon, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium and dust aerosol
concentration and are hence a major contributor to air pollution.
Hence, the aerosol effects were much greater with transported
aerosols. An indirect aerosol effect was found to be the major effect
and more impactful, with transported aerosols that dominated both
rainfall and RF and suppressed rainfall more significantly than the
direct and semi-direct effect. However, the increase in direct
radiative effects with an increase in transported BC counteracted the
rainfall suppression caused by relevant processes of other aerosol
effects. Thus, this study shows atmospheric transport to be an
important process for this region, as transported emissions,
specifically from the IGP, were also found to have greater control
over the region's rainfall. Thus, emission control policies
implemented in the IGP will reduce air pollution as well as the
climatic impacts of aerosols over the NE India region.</font></font></p>

investigates whether the vehicular black carbon emissions originated

was apportioned between the fossil fuel and biomass burning by
real-time measurements of black carbon concentrations at two distinct
locations having different traffic volumes in 2016–17. The average
observed BC concentrations were 20.58, 6.42, 3.50 and 5.29 μg/m</font></font><sup><font face="Helvetica Neue, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">3</font></font></sup><font face="Helvetica Neue, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">

at the high traffic location in winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon and
post-monsoon seasons, respectively. Temperature, wind speed, and
solar radiation were found to have significant negative correlations
with BC concentrations, while relative humidity had positive
correlations. It was found that vehicles contributed over 85% of the
ambient black carbon at both locations. Black carbon emission from
this dominant source was estimated for 2018, which showed that from
vehicles it increased to 0.44–0.55 Gg in 2018 from 0.29 to 0.33 Gg
in 2011, which may result in the adverse impacts on the eco-sensitive
Brahmaputra River Valley and the Himalayas. The transport and
deposition of black carbon under different climatic seasons was
modelled using HYSPLIT. The results showed that black carbon
particulates are being transported and deposited all-round the year
in the Himalayas and the surrounding region. Pre-monsoon and monsoon
seasons contributed to the largest amounts of deposition, and a clear
relation was found between deposition and rainfall. The total BC
deposited in the Brahmaputra River Valley and the Himalayas during
one year was 22,142.69 kg and 1566.53 kg with average deposition

evaluated the accuracy of six planetary boundary layer (PBL)
parameterization schemes in simulating two different seasons of
pre-monsoon and monsoon in India's North-East region through the
Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Twelve one-month
simulations were conducted with the PBL schemes, six each for April
(pre-monsoon) and July (monsoon), and the model outputs were compared
against observations. Three non-local schemes, Asymmetric Convective
Model (ACM2), Yonsei University (YSU), Shin-Hong (HONG), and three
local schemes, Quasi Normal Scale Elimination (QNSE), Mellor Yamada
Janjic (MYJ) and Mellor Yamada Nakanishi Nino (MYNN3), were tested.
The meteorological variables of temperature, relative humidity (RH),
wind speed, wind direction, and rainfall were evaluated, and the
performance of each scheme for each meteorological variable is
reported. The 2 m temperature (T2) variable was well simulated by
ACM2, MYJ in April, and YSU in July, while MYNN3 best simulated the
2 m RH (RH2) during both seasons. 10 m wind speed (WS10) and
directions (WD10) were better simulated by MYNN3, HONG and YSU. HONG
also best-simulated rainfall in April and MYJ in July. April and July
being rainfall periods, an analysis of the schemes’ simulated
rainfall frequency was also carried out. Moreover, the PBL schemes
were also ranked, considering their combined performance with all the
above meteorological parameters. While considering both the seasons
and all meteorological variables, the scale-aware scheme, HONG, was
the best scheme and can be used to simulate both seasons.
Additionally, an in-depth analysis of surface and atmospheric
parameters was also carried out to reason the simulated meteorology.
QNSE expends the highest amount of its surface energy through surface
evaporation, leading to the lowest surface skin temperature and T2
predictions. In contrast, MYNN3 produced the lowest mixing, which
caused the moistest boundary layer, highest RH, cloud cover, and
highly overestimated rainfall. Besides evaluation, which will help to
choose a suitable PBL scheme for weather predictions in this region,
this study also identifies the characteristics and deficiencies of
PBL and surface layer schemes for improvement.</font></font></p>
